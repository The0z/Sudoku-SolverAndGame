# Learn to solve Sudoku using back tracking
# Backtracking - technique for solving problems recursively one step at a time and 
# removing failed solutions. Basically backtrack when you find solution doesn't work
# 
# Benefits - faster than trying every single combination of numbers
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/
# Explains the need for performance --> performance = currency

# Sudoku 9x9 - Rules - Rows and Columns must contain unique numbers. 3x3 squares must contain
# unique numbers
# Recursive function is the best option.
